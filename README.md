Breast Cancer Project : A simple machine learning project to detect the presence or absence of cancer cells in your body<br>

## About this PROJECT :

Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer in women. It is estimated that one in 10 women may suffer from it sometime during their life. Although a large majority of breast cancer tumours are cured, even today 20% of patients are not. Resistance to treatment or the absence of specific therapies against certain types of breast cancer explains why certain tumours cannot be completely eliminated.

This give me an idea to develop this Breast_Cancer_Project which predicts whether its a cancer cells or not.

# Note

As its my first project so I only use the Logistic Regression as algorithm , but their are several other algorithm as well!! .  
Which can perform better

## How to run the project?

1. Install all the libraries mentioned in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Rawat-Sagar/Breast_Cancer_Project/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
2. Clone this repository in your local system.
3. Open the command prompt from your project directory and run the command `python app.py`.
4. Go to your browser and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in the address bar.
5. That's it , now you can start your predictions.
